# composition represents a situation where we have two different classes that are related to each other 
# but one class is not inherited from the other and one class makes use of code contained in another class 

# example: imagine we have a Package class which represents a software package. It contains attributes about the software 
# package, like name, version, and size. We also have a Repository class which represents all the packages available for 
# installation. While thereâ€™s no inheritance relationship between the two classes, they are related. The Repository class 
# will contain a dictionary or list of Packages that are contained in the repository.
